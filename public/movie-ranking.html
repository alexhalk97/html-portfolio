<hr /> 
<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>A great comeback from addiction by Tom Cruise in The Last Samuarai. Great sneak-peak into japanese culture</p>
<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>Complete banger of Achilles being the hero and main character of the war in Troy. He even stole a virgin.</p>
<h3>Sinister</h3>
<p>Great horror movie.</p>
